## Solutions
_Algebra_ by I.M.Gelfand and A.Shen, first published in September 1993, is a 150 page book
covering 72 topics related to school level algebra. The book presents 342 problems some with
solutions, and others without. 


This booklet aims to provide correct solutions to all the 342 problems listed in _Algebra_
Each solution is carefully checked, either by hand (particularly for proofs)
or programmatically using Scheme (a dialect of Lisp). LLMs have helped me in typing this out in LaTeX. All errors are my own, please report any [issue](https://github.com/deepak-venkatesh/gelfand-algebra/issues)
